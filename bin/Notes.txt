To Fix

-Fix capture. Kinda works like chess now when agent is capturing
-change piece to capital when it gets to other end of board
-When user enters a move, first check it across all valid moves. Currently valid moves are possible
-Prompt user about the only valid move they can make and check their input to make sure it is
as expected. Perhaps combine with above point
-
